  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>1. Information we collect
1.1 Information you provide voluntarily

Tool Desk is primarily a client-side, browser-based suite of small utilities. In general, we do not require registration to use the Site. However, you may voluntarily provide information when you contact us or use features that offer to send output or feedback (for example, submitting feedback, reporting a bug, or contacting the site owner). This may include:

Name (optional)

Email address (if you provide one to receive a reply)

Any content you submit in feedback forms or support messages

1.2 Information collected automatically

When you visit or use the Site, certain information may be collected automatically for security, diagnostics, and analytics purposes:

Browser type and version

Operating system

Referring/exit pages

Pages visited and interactions (page views, button clicks)

IP address and approximate location (country/region)

Device type and basic hardware info

Date and time of access, and other system log data

This data is typically collected via standard web server logs and third-party analytics tools (see Section 4).

1.3 Cookies and similar technologies

We and our service providers may use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to:

Remember basic preferences and settings

Improve performance and reliability

Collect analytics about Site usage

You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies may affect some Site functionality.

2. How we use information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

To operate, maintain, and improve the Site and its tools

To respond to your feedback and support requests (when you provide contact details)

To analyze usage patterns so we can improve UX, features, and performance

To detect, prevent, and respond to security incidents and abuse

To comply with legal obligations

We do not sell your personal information.

3. Sharing and disclosure of information

We may share information in the following limited circumstances:

Service providers: We may use third-party services (e.g., analytics providers, hosting, error monitoring) that process technical and usage data on our behalf. These providers are contractually restricted from using your data except to provide services to the Site.

Legal reasons: We may disclose information to comply with applicable laws, legal processes, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.

Protection: To protect the rights, property, or safety of Tool Desk, our users, or the public.

Where possible we will aggregate or de-identify data to minimize privacy risks.

4. Third-party services and analytics

Tool Desk may use third-party tools and libraries (for example Google Analytics, Plausible, Sentry, or similar) to gather usage and performance data. These services may collect information about your visit (IP address, pages visited, browser, device). The data collected by third parties is subject to their privacy policies; if you want to opt out of analytics you should use the opt-out options offered by those services or block tracking via browser extensions or settings.

Note: If you require a specific list of third-party analytics or libraries currently used on the Site, please tell us and we will provide an up-to-date list.

5. Data retention

We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, or as required to comply with legal obligations. Aggregate or de-identified information may be kept indefinitely for analytics and research.

6. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected through the Site from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security and are not responsible for the actions of third parties who may intercept or access data.

7. Children’s privacy

The Site is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.

8. Your privacy rights and choices

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, such as:

Request access to personal data we hold about you

Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data

Request deletion of your personal data (subject to legal exceptions)

Object to or restrict processing

Request portability of data provided in structured form

To exercise rights, contact us at the address below. We may need to verify your identity before honoring requests.

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, Tool Desk may act as the data controller for data collected via the Site. Residents also have the right to lodge a complaint with their local data protection authority.

California residents: If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). To make CCPA requests, contact us using the information below.

9. International transfers

Tool Desk is hosted and operated from servers that may be located in different countries. If we transfer personal information across borders, we will protect it in accordance with this policy and applicable law.

10. Links to other websites

The Site may contain links to third-party websites. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. When you follow a link to another site, we encourage you to read that site’s privacy policy — we have no control over, and are not responsible for, other sites’ content or practices.

11. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in practices or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the Last updated date at the top. Material changes will be posted on the Site and, when feasible, we will provide more prominent notice.

13. Additional notes & recommended actions for site owner

Replace the contact email above with the email you want users to contact.

If you use specific third-party services (Google Analytics, Plausible, Sentry, Cloudflare, GitHub Pages features, ad networks, etc.), consider listing them explicitly in Section 4 and include links to their privacy policies.

If you enable optional features that collect user content or personal data (e.g., file uploads, server-side processing), update Section 1 and 2 to reflect that behavior.

If you need a shorter “privacy summary” to show in a cookie banner, I can produce that next. .</p>
